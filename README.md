#Purchasing Logic
- Lookup by `ISBN`
- Validate quantity (for PaperBook)
- Send to:
  - `ShippingService` with address (for PaperBooks)
  - `MailService` with email (for EBooks)

- Return total price paid
- Errors thrown if:
  - Book doesnâ€™t exist
  - Not purchasable (e.g., ShowcaseBook)
  - Not enough stock
